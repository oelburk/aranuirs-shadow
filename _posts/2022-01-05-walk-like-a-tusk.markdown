After the group was forced to leave Rune at the Spire alone with the tired and somewhat suspicious caretaker, the group decided to seek out the evil band Blacktusk. After posing as a group of broke bandits, one of the Blacktusks leader figures thought it could be a good idea to use this new band of scoundrels to do a job.

The group was instructed to stop a wagon from entering Silvershire. The wagon approached as they hunkered down behind rocks. Tyrfing stopped the wagon on the bridge and tried to approach them as friendly as the moment allowed, while this was happening Coro whisked his hands and turned himself invisible. While Tyrfings charm wasn’t working as expected (or as maybe as everybody thought) the fellows on the wagon got tired of his yapping and pulled arms.

In a swift move, Brurblack approached the wagon from the back and Tyrfing handled the opponents from the front. The fight was over quite quickly and bodies were pushed over the bridge, during the fight, Coro broke in from the back and discovered the precious cargo which turned out to be cases of frost tonics. So in spite Coro snatched a pack of six bottles.

The ugly Blacktusk leader, a goblin who followed the group to the bridge, offered payment for the cargo but unknowing of Coro’s little heist. He also offered the group a ride back for the same amount he gave as payment, the group refused and walked back.

With the newly “found” bottles of frost tonic, the group ventured back to the adventures guild and happily sold the bottles to the quest giver, a seemingly rich and pompous individual who probably would use the tonics for its intoxicating capabilities.

With the trust gained from the job at the bridge, the group returned to the Blacktusk tavern in hope of getting closer to the actual source of the gang. But, villains aren’t to be trusted, and it seemed like the group hadn’t gained much renown from the wagon job. Instead of relying on the trust of shady characters, the group stalked a Blacktusk individual from the tavern to what seemed like a hideout, a small rundown shack in the outskirts of the impoverished part of Silvershire.

Coro summoned his familiar, a fey spider named Gunnar, to enter the shack and observe the hideout's innards. While using his familiar's senses he told Brurblack and Tyrfing about the secret trap door within the fireplace, the group was now sure that this was it. After a discussion on how to tackle the situation, they decided to capture and interrogate a Blacktusk member who just left the shack. Enraged by his brethren's death Tyrfing led a gruesome interrogation which ended with smashed fingers and a large stone crushing the Blacktusk member (with the morals of making it look like an accident).

Brurblack lead the group in the shack and walked down the trapdoor to its dark corners with the knowledge that Leifur might be the one holding the Stein Rune.

Stay tuned for the next chapter in...
