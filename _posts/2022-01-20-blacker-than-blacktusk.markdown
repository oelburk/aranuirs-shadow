In the bellows of the shack, the group ventured on in darkness. Brurblack led the rest of the group through dim lit hallways and they stumbled upon a group of Blacktusk bandits. After swift swashbuckling and some involuntarily bloodletting the group managed to bash their way through and continue down the corridors, hunting down rest of the Blacktusk's remaining brethren.

Numerous encounters later they found the remains of Tyrfings companion, locked up and dead. With even more rage Tyrfing rose up with determination that Leifur must be dealt with. While Tyrfing was mourning his dead friend some members of the group managed to find treasures, treasures which they currently do not understand and whose importance may shift the luck of their adventure to their favor. Brurblack found a staff which was higher than himself and Snarf found a bag of what seemed to be a bag of endless possibilities.

There was one walk-way which the group had left to go down, probably what would lead them to the room of the leader, or for what they know the local leader, who from the start of the Burning Trees adventure caused them pain and suffering. After a time of discussion, Brurblack decided to go in and scout ahead. Brurblack then came back and told Tyrfing, Coro and Snarf about the manpower which lied ahead, it wouldn't be easy but the group knew that they could handle it.

With the wisps of his long gnarly looking fingers Coro mumbled a spell which turned Brurblack invisible. While invisible, Brurblack stealthily took a spot next to the man who they thought was Leifur and when the moment was right Brurblack would strike his daggers into the man. In line three brave individuals stood before Leifur, upon which Leifur said - "Buhahaha, now you meet death!". Shortly after that, Lefiurs vision deteriorated into nothingness. Alone in the abyss, with only the sounds of a mean gnome stabbing away at his torso and rustles of the swords of his guards, panic gripped the man. It was Coro who yet again had uttered another spell to rob Leifur of his sight. Blind and panicked his arms was flailing while his guards was manhandled by Snarf and Tyrfing.

Then, when Leifur regained his sight, the first thing he saw was the eyes, or what was supposed to be eyes, of Coro. The eye sockets of the man was just a black void, confusion on top of the panic he already got from the sudden blindness hit him like a sledgehammer. In a second, a black and green oozing beam originating from Coros hands hit Leifur in the chest. He could feel his soul torn from the inside but managed to stay on his feet, poisoned.

"It can't get any worse than this" - Leifur thought but he was wrong; his days, just turned into minutes, were numbered. From a distance Snarf yelled out and in an instant Lefiur was no bigger than the gnome hanging from his chest. Tyrfing, who had just slain Leifurs right hand man saw his shot of redemption and with all his might, buried anger and power of the gods he lifted his hammer.

Three seconds of pure silence, just the breath of the two men in an empty arena meeting each others gaze.

*Inhale* - *exhale* - *WHOOOOSH!* - *Hammer down!* 

**It.** **Hit.** **HARD.** No skull cap would have saved you from that swing of rage and revenge. Leifurs skull cracked like a cherry and Tyrfings soul became more whole than it had been for months.

Now tired, the group gather themselves and observed the carnage that had taken place. While going through the bookcases in the room Snarf managed to find a secret handle which opened up a storage area. While searching the hidden area, the group discovered a peculiar chest and with the help of Brurblacks questionable lockpicking skills the chest was opened.

Inside laid a stone, but not just any stone, this could perhaps be one of the runes that the adventurers was looking for. Coro picked it up and felt a strange sensation, it was heavy but also light as a feather. He could not really place it but it felt special and since he's not the strongest man around he asked if Tyrfing could carry the strange stone.

On the way out the group decided to honor Tyrfings lost brother and carry the deceased dwarf in a torch march through the city to the closest funeral home. There they would send back Tyrfings fallen friend to his homeland and make sure that he would be taken care of his family.

Now when the dust has settled and fallen comrades are taken care of the group now rests in one of the finer establishments in the city with a nice bath, food and drinks around.

What will happen next, is the stone really the rune that they were looking for and does Folwin really have good intentions? Stay tuned for the next chapter in...
